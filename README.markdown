### Description

This is a brief introduction to using markdown support for producing reports
in Python, R, and Matlab.

> This is designed to be a light overview, and for those of you who use LaTeX, 
> we would recommend using LaTeX in favour of markdown languages.

## Requirements

 * **R** - RStudio
 * **MATLAB** - Matlab IDE. 
 * **Python** - Python 2.7 and the JetBrains PyCharm IDE 
(professional edition is available to students for free).

### LaTeX

While this course is not an introduction to LaTeX, we will use some of its referencing 
and mathematical features. This will include:
  - Making small tables. 
  - Referencing figures. 
  - Citing sources.
  - Writing equations.
  - Formatting sections.
  - Including code segments. 

We will however try to keep the external packages used and LaTeX commands to a 
minimal amount however for ease of learning.
